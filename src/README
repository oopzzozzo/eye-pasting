Download face marking model
> make download_model

Download >40 pairs of testing image from CSIE workstation to directory in/.
> make download_data
# Requires CSIE workstation account

Run over all image pairs in directory in/
> make all
# Each pair of images shoule be named "<name>_c.jpg" and "<name>_o.jpg"
# The result images would be named "<name>_out.jpg" and placed in the directory out/
# This is pretty time consuming due to upsampling for better performance in face detection
